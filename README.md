# A Video Game Themed React Calendar

This repo houses the code for my entry into the [R-Studio Table competition.](https://community.rstudio.com/tag/table-contest)

It is built with `reactable`, and is (currently) hosted as an `shiny` application. It is best viewed in full-screen.

Please consider viewing the table through an animated gif I created [here](https://github.com/mattkumar/react_calendar/blob/main/screencap.gif?raw=true)
 
You can also view my entry live as a `shiny` app [here](https://matt-kumar.shinyapps.io/react_calendar/)
